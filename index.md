## Web projects

### [New Ideas](./works/web-new-ideas/)
This web is responsive and it is made only with HTML, CSS and some vanilla Javascript (events and DOM) for the mobile menu. First section is thought to be shown on the whole visor view when you access it. In addition, I have used the CSS clip-path property to create divisors between sections and introduce the about section's image in a perfect circle. The menu icons have been introduced from Google Icon's web. 

### [Skater](./works/web-skater/)
Realized with bootstrap to make this web responsive too. The icons used are SVG format so I have to colorize and sizing with his own properties inside the file in some cases.

### [POC Works](./works/web-poc-works/)
The first objetive to this web is to learn about blend mode in CSS. This web is not responsive, but I used media queries to a better adapt the design.

### [Design](./works/web-design/)
A little class practise. In this case I use bootstrap to make the design responsive, changing the number of columns according to the visor resolution. There are two methods to load the images. One using the <img> HTML element and the CSS object-fit property, and the oher using directly CSS brackground properties.

### [Dopetrope](./works/web-dopetrope/)
Another class practise with bootstrap using his own classes to make the design responsive. In this time, I also used some bootstrap components like cards.
